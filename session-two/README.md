###Introduction

The strawberry is a uniquely beautiful and delicious fruit. *Way* better than the blackberry, blueberry, or, god forbid, raspberry. We like to worship the strawberry in a pagan ritual, nude, as illustrated by Hieronymous Bosch. Sometimes, a bird will steal and eat a strawberry, depriving us of our ability to worship it, as illustrated here by William Morris.

Look at the mystical, magical strawberry grow! There is nothing like it. How rare that one can watch the birth of a god in *almost* real time. Pay particular attention to the redenning of the fruit, a process that we like to call the descent of the holy spirit. There is an elegance to this process that the *raspberry* can only dream of.

Now, let's consider some early depictions of the strawberry such as this miraculous illustration by famed illustrator Redout√© published in 1833. This can be used for worship by those who do not have access to real strawberries themselves, though it has raised some controversy as acting as a kind of false idol.

[^1]: This is just common sense.
[^2]: The practice of strawberry worship goes back to the earliest humans. It can be seen in the cave paintings at the caves of Lascaux.
[^3]: These birds are, of course, killed.

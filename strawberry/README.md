The plump, red, sweet strawberry is filled with symbolic contradictions. Seemingly antithetical meanings have been applied to this fruit and flower, some more or less compatible with characteristics of the fruit itself. Strawberries, or specifically Fragaria vesca, appear frequently in the borders of illuminated manuscripts beginning in the early fifteenth century.  Colorful, round, and conveniently located on trailing green vines, the visual form of the strawberry is well suited this decorative function. Strawberries appear among birds, beasts, and flowers in the decorative borders of Books of Hours, or medieval prayer books. Interestingly, both the visual appeal and the symbolic value of the strawberry in the illuminated manuscript comes not just from the red fruit for which we now know it, but from its delicate white flowers. Is it just its decorative beauty that explains the ubiquity of the strawberry in fifteenth century illuminated manuscripts or is there some kind of greater religious symbolism to the fruit and flower?

The answer to this question comes in depictions of two Biblical gardens. The wild European Fragaria vesca often appears in depictions of the garden of Eden before the fall of Adam and Eve. Strawberries are below the feet of Adam and Eve in Giovanni di Paolo’s The Creation of the World and the Expulsion from Paradise (1445) though in this case without their customary white flowers. Along with the lilies and roses, the fruit is intended to represent the perfect righteousness of Christ’s followers as well as the fruitful results of their worship.
